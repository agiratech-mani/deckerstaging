    <p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">Module 1:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">Get Ready, Get Set</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hi, I&rsquo;m Ben. Welcome to Decker Digital: Communicate To Influence! First things first: this isn&rsquo;t your standard snooze and click e-learning training, like some kind of boring driver&rsquo;s education course where you painstakingly click, click, snooze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;ve designed this program to be highly interactive, and you&rsquo;ll learn a lot about your own communication in the process. So, get ready to work!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hi, I&rsquo;m Kelly. You&rsquo;ll see Ben again shortly. The two of us are going to be walking you through this program.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, here are a few things about the design of the program that you need to know. After this short intro, you&rsquo;ll progress through six bite-sized modules, each ranging in length from 10 minutes to 30 minutes. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll work through the whole program in one sitting. But it&#39;s not a problem if you can&rsquo;t &ndash; we&rsquo;ll save your spot, and you can pick right back up where you left off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Once you&rsquo;ve completed a module, it will be unlocked and you can go back and revisit it at any time. You&rsquo;ll see all the modules right here in the navigation, so that you can take a peek at what you&rsquo;ve already completed and what&rsquo;s yet to come.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You can always view a transcript of each module&rsquo;s content by clicking on the transcript icon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So first, let&rsquo;s check your system settings.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">At several points during the program, you&rsquo;ll step into what we call the Decker Digital Lab. This is where the magic happens. Here, you&rsquo;ll test and drill your communication habits, practice new skills, and create a plan to keep getting better and better.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here, you&rsquo;ll find your work station, which is a tool kit that&rsquo;s always accessible so that you can take a note on your notepad, see your prep for each section, and of course, review handy reference tools and guides. There&rsquo;s always a way to get support if you need it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s get set up by following right along with&nbsp;Kevin.</p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Location, location, location: It&rsquo;s best to find an area that&#39;s a bit more private, maybe close your office door or go into an empty conference room. If that&rsquo;s not available, just put on a set of headphones.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>

Here, you&rsquo;ll test and drill your communication habits by recording yourself &ndash; yes, recording yourself &ndash; and playing back your recording. Now we know that this is not on the top of anyone&rsquo;s list, but trust us! There is no better way to learn about your communication habits and challenges, and to understand the steps to become an even more effective communicator. You&rsquo;ll record yourself, practice new skills, and create a plan to keep getting better and better.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lighting: Make sure your source of light is coming towards you, rather than from behind you. Don&#39;t sit in front of a window or you&#39;ll only see a silhouette of yourself. Instead, move yourself to face the window so you&#39;re in the light and not in the shadows.

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">Module 2:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">Why Influence?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">2_2_CAN-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;re really good at sharing information. We&rsquo;re trained to do this starting in school. But unless you&rsquo;re a news reporter, simply providing information just doesn&rsquo;t cut it. Now, what we&rsquo;re not so great at is communicating to&nbsp;influence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Information vs. influence. These create two completely different experiences for an audience, whether that audience is one person, 10 people or a group of 100. How do we communicate to influence?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Some people use authority &ndash; it&rsquo;s tried and true, but it&rsquo;s also tired. Especially when you consider the way that teams and organizations work today, where there&#39;s less formal authority and a need to collaborate across business units. We need to be influencing all the time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Classic authority doesn&rsquo;t always work.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So we ask &ndash; from business partners, to clients, to colleagues, how do we really get through?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now before we continue you might be thinking &ldquo;Hmmm&hellip;this is a program on speaking and I&rsquo;m not a public speaker.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">But here&rsquo;s a news flash: you&rsquo;re always public speaking! There is no such thing as private speaking!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">While it&rsquo;s true that we may not have formal speaking opportunities all the time, each one of us communicates many times a day, every single day of the week. And although most of us aren&rsquo;t aware of it, even if we&rsquo;re just talking on the phone or we&#39;re in the hallway, we&#39;re creating a communication experience as soon as we open up our mouths for our listeners.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since we&rsquo;re always communicating, we can implement these principles every single day. This training is your opportunity to hone your communication skills so you can stop informing, and start influencing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Think about a recent communication experience you had&hellip;maybe a meeting, a sales pitch, or a one-on-one conversation with your boss. How&#39;d you feel during that experience? Was it exciting and inspirational? Or was it long, boring, and totally irrelevant to you?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">2_4_CAN-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re like most people we coach, it was probably pretty uninteresting. To make sure you&rsquo;re not in that boring zone when you&rsquo;re the speaker, the secret&#39;s actually quite simple. It&rsquo;s really all about engaging the audience and understanding what they need.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Every person in your audience is thinking, &ldquo;What can you do for me? How does this relate to me?&rdquo; And therein lies a great opportunity &ndash; and one that many of us miss &ndash; the opportunity to influence them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this program, we&rsquo;ll break down the communication experience, which includes:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The message &ndash; that&#39;s what you say</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And the messenger &ndash; and that&rsquo;s you, and how you come across as you&rsquo;re saying it</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ll learn how to connect with the people in your audience, creating a message that&#39;s so relevant to them, they can&rsquo;t sit idly by. We&rsquo;ll challenge you to move past just providing information, hoping that people will know what to do with it. Because your real objective is to influence them to change the way they think or act.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The need for great communication has never been more urgent. There&rsquo;s much to be changed, new ideas to launch, and greater connections to establish.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Whether you&rsquo;re a product manager for a tech company, a customer service rep for an insurance company, a relationship manager in finance, maybe part of a fundraising team for a non-profit, or if you&rsquo;re just trying to get your kids to change their study habits, you have to drive your audience members to action and influence them to change.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here are our goals for you:</span>
    </p>
    <div>
        <ul class="c8 bullet-ul start">
            <li><span>Become aware of your habits and how you come across.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>Learn some tricks to boost your connection, rapport and likeability, which will help you strike the right balance between polish and passion.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>Get a framework to help you organize your message of influence.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>And push yourself so you can get outside your comfort zone!</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>Finally, to have that growth mindset &ndash; you can make a change!</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Okay &ndash; now it&rsquo;s your turn. What are your personal goals during this program?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">2_6_CAN-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Great, you&rsquo;ll be able to check in on those goals at the end of our program.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, let&rsquo;s break down the communication experience. And remember, this is for an in-person meeting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ll see here &ndash; the 3Vs of communication:</span>
    </p>
    <div>
        <ul class="c8 bullet-ul start">
            <li><span>Verbal</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>Vocal</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>And Visual</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Verbal: this is the content of your message, the words that you say.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vocal: this is actually what your audience hears, the sound, the tone, the pitch, projection of your voice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And finally, the Visual: this is what people see as you deliver a message. Things like facial expression, gestures, etc.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now here&rsquo;s a question for you: what do you think counts most &ndash; influences your listener the most &ndash; in a face-to-face meeting or conversation?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">2_8_CAN-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Before we reveal the answer, let&rsquo;s do a quick exercise. First, make an OK sign with your hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hold it out in front of you.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hold it above your head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hold it out to the side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, put it on your chin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Did I get you?!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re like most people, you followed that visual cue and you had your hand resting firmly on your cheek, instead of on your chin. This demonstrates what&rsquo;s most important &ndash; the visual!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, when it comes to communicating, statistics tell us 7% of communication is verbal, 38% is vocal and 55% is visual.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This research is from a classic study by Albert Mehrabian. Let me begin first by telling you what these numbers don&#39;t mean. They don&#39;t mean that only 7% accounts for the content of the message &ndash; that it&rsquo;s all style with no substance to back it up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">What they do mean is that when you have an inconsistent message &ndash; that is, &nbsp;when the words that you say don&rsquo;t match how you come across as you say them &ndash; people believe those visual and vocal cues over the actual words themselves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, the visual and vocal completely block the verbal. Now, this is a big deal when we consider our own communications.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">When people listen to us speak, they are immediately deciding whether or not to trust us, believe us, or buy into what we&#39;re saying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">When the 3Vs are all in line &ndash; when the words that you say match the way you come across as you&rsquo;re saying them &ndash; your listeners are more likely to trust you, like you and believe what you say.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Let me ask you this: what percentage of time do you spend on each of those 3Vs when you prepare for a meeting, a pitch or a presentation?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">2_10_CAN-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re like the majority of people that we work with, you spend close to 99% &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; if not 100% &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; on the Verbal component: the content of the message.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We think, &ldquo;If I say the words, people are gonna get it,&rdquo; but what we need to realize is that message comes through us, both in how we sound and how we come across.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If that communication is inconsistent, we&rsquo;ve wasted a whole lot of time preparing content that ultimately may never get through to our audience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s time to ask ourselves, &ldquo;How do I come across when I speak? How am I perceived by my listeners? Am I connecting? Do they trust me? Do they find me believable?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This makes a great case to focus on the behavioral aspects of communication &ndash; the Visual and the Vocal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s move on to our first set of tools: The Behaviors of Trust</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">Module 3:</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c5">Behaviors of Trust: Connection</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">People judge quickly. In fact, we all judge &ndash; and we do it in the blink of an eye. People form impressions of you every time you speak. Research shows that these instantaneous judgements and initial impressions matter, even to those you know well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Our challenge as communicators is to create trust quickly. What we need is instant trust, the kind of trust where you can just add water. Whether it&#39;s pancakes, oatmeal, soup, or even rice, there&rsquo;s a reason that &ldquo;just add water&rdquo; recipes are so popular and easy &ndash; and you know what the outcome will be! That&#39;s my kind of recipe.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Your goal is to build trust that quickly &ndash; and with just as much certainty!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So the question is: in your existing work group, how do you get them to trust you?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">How do you help them know that you can handle an additional challenge on that next project, that you&rsquo;re going to make great use of the resources, that you will maintain, not destroy, existing relationships with key vendors, partners, and even team members?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The way you show up in front of others &ndash; in person or over the phone &ndash; is critical to generating trust quickly. Just as important though, is continuing to build trust and maintaining that trust over time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So where do you start? The Behaviors of Trust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here&rsquo;s the great news: our behaviors are habits, which means that we can change them. Great communicators are made, not born. Our goal here is to help you become more aware of your habits, and then you can apply ways to replace those ineffective habits with effective ones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Behaviors of Trust fall into two main categories: </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Connection and Credibility. In this module, we&rsquo;ll tackle Connection, and we&rsquo;ll save Credibility for Module 4.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So let&rsquo;s dive in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Connection. It&rsquo;s something you recognize instantly when you see it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Take a look at these two speakers. Who has a better connection with their listener?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;ll notice here, his eyes are looking away from his audience. This tells his listeners, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nervous, uncertain, unfocused.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the other hand, her eyes are looking directly at her audience. Her extended eye communication says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident, purposeful and involving.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now look at his posture. We see him slouching a bit here, resting back on his hip. This can come across as aloof, even standoffish, as if he&#39;s saying, &quot;I don&#39;t really want to be here.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s standing tall in a controlled, ready position. This helps her audience feel like she wants to be there, that she&rsquo;s energetic and engaged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">When it comes to facial expression, he has a furrowed brow, a bored look. This pushes people away, undermining his otherwise positive message.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">She here, however, is looking at her audience with an open, light expression. This comes across as likable, friendly, enthusiastic and authentic, as if she&rsquo;s inviting her audience in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now it&rsquo;s time to put these connection principles into practice. We&rsquo;ll begin with eye communication, since it&rsquo;s the starting point for connection. Let&rsquo;s head to the Lab.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re about to speak to an audience. Tell your audience about your day so far, starting from when you woke up. What&#39;s happened?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Once you hit record, you&#39;ll begin speaking. Your job is to look only at the person who is in the spotlight while you speak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">As we go along, the spotlight will move faster, darting through the audience. And then it will slow down, remaining on audience members for a few seconds at a time. Just keep looking at the person in the spotlight. And keep talking until time is up, then hit &ldquo;stop recording.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Got it?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oh, and one more thing: remember to sit up tall and center yourself in the frame as you record.</span>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Great job! While we process your video, let&rsquo;s talk about what you just did and why.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This exercise was designed to exaggerate the difference between eye contact and true eye communication.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">At first we moved the spotlight frequently, to make your eyes dart quickly from one person to the next. This is what most of us do when we get up in front of a room full of people. We look around and, even though technically we&#39;re looking at people, we&#39;re not really connecting. From the audience&rsquo;s perspective, they see you as being scattered, uncertain, or nervous.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gradually we extended the length of the spotlight focus, which gave you more time for eye communication with each person.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">How did this feel?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">When we hold eye communication for a full five seconds, as you did toward the end of the exercise, people perceive this as feeling interested, confident, that you want to involve them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Let’s watch your playback to see the difference now.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;re pretty good at eye communication in one-&#x2060;on-&#x2060;one conversations.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We typically look at one person for 7-10 seconds, break for a moment to look out the window or down at the materials in front of us, and then we lock back in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">But everything tends to change the moment more people enter the room. We&rsquo;re not sure where to look, or for how long. We think, &ldquo;Do I look at the person who&rsquo;s nodding and smiling &hellip; or the one who&#39;s got their arms crossed?&rdquo; We get nervous, so we quickly begin glancing from person to person, or we give up and look down at the floor. But neither of these behaviors will help us connect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">To help you address a group with better eye communication, here are a couple easy tips:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">One: Follow the 5-second rule. We take that 7-10 second rule for one-on-one communication and scale it back to three to five seconds of eye communication per person in a group environment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Two: Treat your audience as a collection of individuals. Think of it as having one-on-one conversations with people who happen to be seated in a group.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Remember how it feels to really look at your listeners? It may seem long at first, but it feels natural to your listeners and makes a real impact.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, how do we apply this in different situations? Let&#39;s take a more formal setting, where you&#39;re speaking to a roomful of 30+ people &ndash; the same 5-second rule applies.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, you can actually leverage the distance between you and the audience to your advantage. While you may be looking at one person, they&rsquo;re far enough away that at least a dozen people around that individual feel you&rsquo;re looking directly at them. With a single, steady 5-second look, you&rsquo;re making a connection with several people at once. As you shift your focus to different individuals throughout the room, the entire audience becomes connected by your eye communication.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">When you&rsquo;re in a virtual meeting, simply treat the camera as an audience member. If your entire audience is virtual, you&rsquo;ll want to look directly at the webcam the whole time. This may be tough to do if you don&rsquo;t have someone to look at, so you can even draw a smiley face on a sticky note or place a photo of a friend or pet near the camera. Focus completely on that green or red &quot;record&quot; light.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you have a mixed audience, where some are virtual and others are in-person, you&rsquo;ll want to spend half of your eye attention on the people in the room and half looking into the camera. And in a very small meeting, be inclusive and take turns looking at everyone for five full seconds each. In other words, don&rsquo;t just focus on the decision-makers in the room. Those other influencers matter... a lot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, a quick note on cultural differences. It&rsquo;s important to know that all cultures use eye communication differently, so take note of what&rsquo;s acceptable where you&rsquo;re communicating, and remember that eye communication is the key to being a powerful communicator in many countries around the world.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If eye communication is the starting point for great connection, your posture and gestures accelerate the experience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Posture is essentially how you hold your body, and whether we want to admit it or not, it communicates a lot to our audience. Take a look...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Notice she&rsquo;s slouching, almost pulling into herself. This says, &ldquo;I&#39;m nervous, I&rsquo;d rather be anywhere else!&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here he&rsquo;s overly casual, which signals, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not passionate or interested in what I have to say, and I&#39;m really not interested in you, for that matter.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here she&rsquo;s engaged, which tells her audience, &ldquo;I&#39;m confident, I want to be here.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s the only one who&rsquo;s really connecting with her listeners.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here&rsquo;s how to make sure your posture is adding to &ndash; not taking away from &ndash; your connection.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Use the ready position. The ready position is a term that comes from athletics. It&rsquo;s all about positioning your body to perform at its best.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, I can&rsquo;t hit a tennis ball if I&rsquo;m standing like this or save any goals as a keeper if I stand like this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We don&rsquo;t recommend communicating that way, either.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So here&rsquo;s the key &ndash; and come on, you can do this with me! Stand wherever you are, as awkward as that may feel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The ready position for speaking is&hellip;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stand up straight. Imagine a string pulling your head up to the ceiling and draw your shoulder blades down your back. And balance your weight evenly across the balls of your feet and lean forward, not back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Get it? Good. Go ahead and sit back down.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, there&rsquo;s also a ready position for when you&rsquo;re seated. You&rsquo;ll want to move to the front of your seat. You can try this right now, too. Sit up straight, rest your arms comfortably at the table and lean forward, without putting weight on your elbows.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Think of the ready position as your home base. You begin your meeting or presentation here, come back to it several times, and remember to end in the ready position, too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that, let&rsquo;s move on to gestures. Here&rsquo;s where we get the number one question, &ldquo;What do I do with my hands?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">First and foremost, figure out what your nervous gesture is. We&rsquo;ve seen them all:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The fig leaf.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The server.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hands in prayer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The ring twirler.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The tent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feeding the chickens.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And the dreaded Tyrannosaurus Rex.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gestures inject energy into the equation! They can add a sense of ownership and control over the experience. Or, if you&rsquo;re not careful, they can totally distract your audience and take over your entire presentation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">When we get nervous, we get more inhibited, tighter, and we tend to do more repetitive gestures. So the question is, what&rsquo;s the sweet spot between too many gestures and not enough?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s all about balance between working and resting your hands. When they work, they work big. Use whatever gestures you&rsquo;re already making, just get them as far away from your body as possible. Let your gestures emphasize your message and add impact.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">When you practice, you can think about matching your gestures to your content. Tell a fish story about the huge fish you caught&hellip; Or compare and contrast numbers&hellip; And talk about raising performance. Then, when they rest, place them at your sides. Remember, just go to the ready position.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We&#39;ve seen how eye communication, posture and gestures help connect and add energy into your communication experience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, the final piece of the puzzle is facial expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re about to see a video clip of two different people leading two different meetings, but it will not have any sound. Based on just the behavior alone, whose meeting would you rather be in?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here&rsquo;s the interesting thing: the content of each message was exactly the same, a neutral message about compliance and mandatory coverage, but the facial expressions result in a totally different experience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Remember the 3 Vs? This is a great reminder about the importance of the visual component. Especially when it comes to facial expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So often, we feel like we have to be serious to show our credibility and get the audience&rsquo;s respect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, one of our clients, a telecom executive, said, &ldquo;Our corporate headquarters building is hierarchical. The execs sit at the top floor. The higher up you go in that 36-floor building, the more serious the people get.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">But consider social psychologist Amy Cuddy&rsquo;s research. She says, &ldquo;Warmth is the conduit of influence.&rdquo; Her research at Harvard Business School shows that we actually seek warmth first, and competence second.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So how do you show warmth? A smile is the simplest way to add warmth to an experience, although it&#39;s not always the easiest. When you smile, you come across open and warm, calm and comfortable. We&#39;re not talking about a crazy ear-to-ear smile that&rsquo;ll take you into this cheesy zone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Instead, think about having a lightness in your face. There&#39;s a difference in speaking like this, versus lifting your cheeks and opening up your expression through your eyebrows. The key is to make sure the words you say match your facial expression. And the next time you&rsquo;re excited about a project or have a lot of passion for your message, notify your face!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Facial expression, posture, gestures and eye communication are all critical components for building connection. Now that you know how to connect and engage with your audience, you have the first half of the trust equation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Next up? We&rsquo;ll move on to Module 4, for the other half of that equation: credibility.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">Module 4:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">Behaviors of Trust: Credibility</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">4_2_CAN-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now it&rsquo;s time to talk about the other half of the trust equation: credibility. Because you have to assure your audience that they can believe what you have to say.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And that&rsquo;s not just getting through our facts and figures. It&rsquo;s also through how we come across. In fact, we perceive credibility through confidence, focus and polish.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Take a listen to this: it&rsquo;s a department supervisor pitching the management team to get resources for a new project. How credible does it sound?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know, this project is, you know, a key pillar of our bigger strategy for next year, and you know, it&rsquo;s um, it&rsquo;s vital to have, you know, the right financial support in place so we can, um, you know, hire the right people for the team, you know, and start the first quarter really strong, and um, you know, be able to meet our team goals much later in the year. Strong financial backing now will, um, you know, set us up for success all year long, you know? So, you know, we need to make sure that we&#39;re all, you know, on the same page. And I look forward to uh, you know, uh, uh a really strong first quarter.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">What did you notice about the speaker in that clip? You probably heard him say &ldquo;you know&rdquo; at least a dozen times!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">My guess is his message didn&rsquo;t plan to have that in there. People use lots of what we call filler words:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="filler">Um.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="filler">So.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="filler">Uh.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="filler">Eh.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="filler">Well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="filler">You know.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="filler">Like.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="filler">Literally.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The list goes on and on!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">But one thing to keep in mind: filler words are not only distracting, they can undermine your credibility. Is it a complete credibility killer in 20 seconds? Maybe not, but what about in a 60-minute meeting? If our speaker continued at his pace of a dozen filler words per 20 seconds, there would be over 2100 &ldquo;you knows&rdquo; in 60 minutes!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s bring it back to the people in your life. You hear these filler words every day. Let&#39;s do a quick exercise and find out who&#39;s using what.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Which filler words does your boss use?</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Check out all these filler words! If you weren&#39;t quite sure of the ones that you use, chances are, you&#39;re using the same ones as people around you. Now, what can you do about it? When it comes to filler words, no matter which words you use most, no matter what language you speak, the solution is always...to pause.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&#39;s an instant way to get your credibility back. Just listen and hear how pausing helped our first speaker.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This project is a key pillar of our bigger strategy for next year.

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">What a difference! There are lots of other reasons to pause. It allows you to think about what you&rsquo;re going to say instead of rambling. It also allows you to catch your breath and not rush. And, of course, you can pause for emphasis &ndash; add a little drama! After all, the famous international man of mystery doesn&rsquo;t introduce himself as BondJamesBond. It&rsquo;s Bond&hellip; James Bond.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">A strong pause can get a listener&rsquo;s attention and help your message sink in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">While the pause is incredibly powerful, it can be tricky to master because it requires us to stop talking! When we pause for just two seconds, it may feel like it&rsquo;s twice as long, and we may think the people in our audience will check out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The good news is that they experience the complete opposite effect: they don&#39;t even notice it, and they&rsquo;re not going to go anywhere. And here&rsquo;s a bonus: pausing also amps up your warmth and ability to connect. It allows you to convey a conversational tone. It makes you easy to listen to. It&rsquo;s worth it to work on the pause.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now let&rsquo;s switch gears and focus on the voice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Do you know what your voice sounds like? Probably not, but it&rsquo;s not as if you don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to find out. Have you listened to your voicemail greeting on your mobile? Have you ever heard your voice recorded on a conference call? Well, lots of other people have and they&rsquo;re judging you for it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Are you credible? Are you trustworthy? Are you engaging enough to keep them tuned in just by the sound of your voice?</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reported that people who hear rough, weak, strained or breathy voices tend to label the speakers as negative, weak, passive or tense.

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Do any of these sound familiar? Maybe you&rsquo;ve been given feedback about upswing, or told that you talk too softly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The only way to improve how you sound is to know how you sound! So let&rsquo;s take a look.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In just a moment, you&#39;ll listen back to the way you sound. And don&rsquo;t be worried if it feels like an out of body experience, that you&rsquo;re listening to a total stranger. That&rsquo;s because the way your voice sounds in your head is not the way others hear it.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s how you sound. Let&rsquo;s break it down.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">When it comes to your voice, your goal is vocal variety.  Think of that variety as a roller coaster, with ups and downs in two key areas:</span></p>
    <div>
        <ul class="c8 bullet-ul">
            <li><span>Pitch. This is how high or low your tone goes.</span></li>
            <li><span>And then volume. This is how loud or soft your voice is.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">When you create vocal variety, your audience stays tuned in and pays attention to what you&rsquo;re saying. If you get too flat, too soft or too monotone &ndash; and you&rsquo;ve certainly been in meetings where that&rsquo;s happened &ndash; you&rsquo;re only giving your audience an opportunity to tune out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It can be hard to detect your own vocal variety, so we&rsquo;re going to show you.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Did you see peaks and valleys? If so, great! That&#39;s the goal here. What you don&#39;t want to see is too little variation. Small peaks and valleys suggest a monotone experience.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">4_17_CA-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">How&rsquo;d you do? Your pitch can be right on, but you might be speaking too softly to keep others engaged. Remember, you want to keep your voice strong.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">As you work on creating credibility with your voice, here are a couple of reminders:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In order to improve your pitch, add variety by punching it up at points of emphasis.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If upswing is your issue, end your sentences as statements rather than questions, finishing at a lower tone than when you begin them.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">As for volume, don&#39;t simply project your voice. Push your voice out &ndash; not up &ndash; as you speak. And don&#39;t trail off at the end of sentences.</span></p>
 
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, we&#39;re sending you back to the Lab to practice again.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">For up to 30 seconds, tell us about your favorite technology, like an app or an invention. As you record, remember to pay attention to your pitch and your volume.Really try to overdo it so that you can hear the difference!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It might feel uncomfortable, but that&#39;s a good thing. You&#39;re changing habits and the Lab is a great place to start. Give it a try!</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Did it feel different the second time around? As you listen back to the second recording, look for vocal variety. Before you do, here are examples showing good vocal variety, to help you see what you're aiming for.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now hit play and see how you compare.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">How'd you do? Notice any improvements? Whether you nailed it or need to keep working, don&#39;t stop here. Keep recording yourself and listening back in your everyday life. If you&#39;re leaving a voicemail or chiming in on a conference call, you can boost your credibility by practicing the power of the pause and being intentional with your voice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The skills around connection and credibility can be challenging because our habits are so entrenched.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">As you practice these skills, keep in mind that you have to get outside your comfort zone. There is a disparity of how we feel internally and how we actually come across as we&#39;re changing our habits. So push yourself to overdo it and don&#39;t let comfort be your guide.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">For example, it may feel horribly uncomfortable and unnatural to make a large gesture or boost the volume of your voice. And while that feels huge to you, your audience will probably say it could still be bigger, or louder &ndash; and they&#39;ll find you more confident, dynamic and inspiring as a result.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, if it feels uncomfortable, you&#39;re on the right track. As you improve, you&rsquo;ll learn to take each skill and dial it up or down to make the connection that&rsquo;s right for your audience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">For example, you need to dial it up for big energy on a big stage, and then dial it down for a one-on-one meeting. Just realize that you&rsquo;re in control of your Behaviors of Trust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And now that you&rsquo;ve explored them all, which two behaviors will you focus on?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We call these Pivot Points &ndash; changes you can make that will make a pivotal difference in your communications experience. Just like improving a golf swing, it&rsquo;s important not to try and change everything all at once. That&rsquo;s why we recommend you start with two, and as you master these, you can layer on additional skills as you progress.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So for now, which two will you choose as your Pivot Points?</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">When you demonstrate connection and credibility, you&rsquo;re well on your way to getting buy-in because people trust you. Whether you&rsquo;re giving a big funding pitch, making a plea for a deadline extension, handling a difficult colleague, selling a new product, or even on the home front, it could be when you&#39;re getting your kids to focus on their homework, the Behaviors of Trust can make a difference.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now so far we&rsquo;ve focused on honing your skills as the messenger, and now it&rsquo;s time to look at improving the message.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In our upcoming module, we&rsquo;ll dive into crafting your content. To do that, you&rsquo;ll need something to talk about. Start thinking of a topic, something that requires you to influence your listener. It could be work related &ndash; securing budget or resources, or proposing a new idea. Or choose something near and dear to your heart &ndash; a cause or a charity. Once you&rsquo;ve got your topic in mind, get ready to discover how to take your message to the next level.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Old habits die hard. Not just the ones we&rsquo;ve been talking about concerning behavior, but also the ones we hold on to when it comes to preparing our content.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Last year, Ben and I sat down to prepare for our annual Decker board meeting. What was the first thing we did to prepare? We whipped out the previous year&rsquo;s PowerPoint deck, of course. We sat there for a good couple of hours, updating old charts and figures. We kept flipping back and forth between the slides. It just wasn&rsquo;t coming together. Finally, we slammed the laptop shut. What happened? We slid right back into our old habits, and had gone about preparing a message in precisely the way that we should not.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Taking out the previous PowerPoint deck? Are you kidding me? It&rsquo;s the cardinal sin of all message preparation! We should have known better &ndash; we teach this, after all!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">But we fell into the trap ourselves, lured by the shiny structure, the completed slides. We thought, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just overcommitted right now, don&rsquo;t have much time, and we&rsquo;ll use last year&rsquo;s template.&rdquo; Sound familiar?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;re all under pressure, and we have zero time, so when we&rsquo;re asked to create a presentation, we head straight for whatever we&rsquo;ve done before. We think, &ldquo;What do I need to tell them?&rdquo; instead of, &ldquo;What do they need to hear?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The result is a data dump, with gobs of precious time wasted. So let&rsquo;s find out where you default. What are your instincts when it comes to preparing a message?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the end of the last module, we asked you to think about a topic. It should be something that you care about, a topic where you&rsquo;d like to influence how others think or act.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Maybe you need buy-in on a project at work, you&rsquo;re asking for additional budget, or you&rsquo;d like to get people involved in a charity in your community. Whatever it is, now&rsquo;s the time to deliver a quick one minute pitch on your topic.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Did you nail it? Well, no matter how good or bad you felt about it, this exercise will help us understand your baseline approach to messaging. And if you&rsquo;re anything like us, maybe you fell into some of the same traps that we did, like &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on my agenda?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How do I share the news?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s time to move from information to influence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, the point of meetings isn&rsquo;t to exchange information. It&rsquo;s to change the way people think or act about your initiative, idea, product, service or process.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re about to learn how to create a focused, audience-centered message, and how to save time doing it. It&rsquo;s a system that will revive all of those meetings of yours.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It will also change the way you think about voicemails, quick chats in the hallway, impromptu meetings with your boss, and even opportunities to catch up with decision-makers. Sound too good to be true? It&rsquo;s not &ndash; you just need the right framework. And this framework is called the Decker Grid. The Grid provides a consistent, easy-to-use system for you to refine and build a compelling message each and every time you speak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;ll tackle the Grid in two parts. First are the Cornerstones. These help not only frame your thinking, but they ultimately become the way that you&rsquo;ll open and close your message.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then you&rsquo;ll finish the full Grid by building out the meat of the message, which is everything your listeners need to know to motivate them to act.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;ll walk through each of these elements separately, and you&rsquo;ll have the chance to practice them along the way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since the Cornerstones are the most important part, this is where you spend most of your time. We&#39;re going to take you through how to think about the Cornerstones.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now normally, when it comes to preparing your message, analog is the way to go. That means grabbing good ol&#39; fashioned sticky notes and a pen. But since this is Decker Digital, you&#39;ll create your Cornerstones and Grid with virtual sticky notes, instead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">There are four elements to the Cornerstones:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <div>
        <ul class="c8 bullet-ul start">
            <li><span>Listeners: You want to make it all about them, and not about you.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>Point of View: Find the lead of your story, a clear perspective.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>Action Steps: Don&rsquo;t be wishy-washy here, make these concrete.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>Benefits: Help your audience see WHY this should matter to them, make them care.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Notice what&rsquo;s listed as number one, because it&rsquo;s the most important component of all: your Listeners.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You might be thinking, &ldquo;Thanks, Kelly. Mind-blowing stuff here. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I got that in Messaging 101.&rdquo; Well, you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s not rocket science. But this cosmic thing happens when we open up our mouths to speak. The message becomes all about us, and has nothing to do with our Listener. Somehow we feel compelled to prove ourselves, our product, our process, and so on. This gets us nowhere, fast.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Understanding our audience is the most critical step in communicating to influence, so to identify your Listeners, step back and really think about them. Even if you&rsquo;ve worked with your audience for years, it&rsquo;s always beneficial to think about how their opinions, thoughts and goals translate to the subject that you&rsquo;re now addressing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">For instance, your audience might be: resistant, hostile and skeptical. Or they might be open, friendly but budget-conscious. Whatever they are, these words will help you keep your audience top-of-mind, making sure that your content stays focused on them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">To create your Listener Profile, you want to answer questions like these:</span>

            </li>
            <li><span>Why are they here? What are they expecting from this meeting or from my message?</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>What do they already know about the subject, and how do they feel about it?</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>Are they data-driven – facts and figures – or business-driven, more focused on big-picture impact?</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>What would make them challenge or resist my message?</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>What problem am I trying to solve that will make their lives better or easier in some way?</span>
            </li>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Andrew Stanton, Pixar&rsquo;s creative force behind <i>Finding Nemo</i> and <i>Toy Story</i>, said, &ldquo;Storytelling [and messaging in general] is like joke telling. It&rsquo;s knowing your punchline, your ending, knowing that everything you&rsquo;re saying, from the first sentence to the last, is leading to a singular goal.&rdquo;</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So what is the ONE point you want your audience to take away? This is your Point of View.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">To create your Point of View, ask yourself the following questions:</span>
    </p>
    <div>
        <ul class="c8 bullet-ul start">
            <li><span>What do I want my audience to do at the end of all of this?</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>What is the biggest change I want my listeners to experience in how they think or act about my topic, about my idea?</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>So, what is my big idea? What&rsquo;s the lead of my story?</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Often, when we need to deliver the same core message to different audiences, that means that we have to change our Point of View accordingly. </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">
    You&rsquo;re about to see two different scenarios. In each scenario, there will be a speaker who needs to communicate a specific topic, with a defined goal, to different audiences. It&rsquo;ll be your job to choose which Point of View works for each audience. Ready? Let&rsquo;s go.</span>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Alright, you&rsquo;re getting the hang of this! As you can see, the Point of View shifts depending on the audience. The trickiest part about nailing the Point of View is figuring out how to make the audience nod their heads in response. It&rsquo;s also important to know what does NOT work when crafting your Point of View.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Next, you&rsquo;ll look at a new scenario. Click to reveal why each Point of View would or would not work.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">With a clear focus on your Listeners, you can create a Point of View that gets them nodding their heads, where they&rsquo;re interested in hearing more. The ideal audience response should be nothing short of, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in! Just tell me where to go!&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Your mindset should be that your Listener buys off on your Point of View and they&#39;re begging to know what to do next. You have to tell them! What&#39;s your Point of View? Think through your big idea, the lead of the story.</span>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Next up are the Action Steps. We&rsquo;ll divide these into General and Specific.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Action Steps make your message more concrete, pointing the way for your audience to go and giving them a clear, logical path to get there. They also provide this golden nugget of accountability so that you can go back and ask, &ldquo;In our last meeting, you committed to completing this task by this week. How&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So first, the General Action Steps. After your audience buys off on your Point of View, offer what&rsquo;s next. Maybe it&rsquo;s an invitation to explore the subject further &ndash; to compare and contrast, to pilot, understand, or just review the case that you&rsquo;ve presented.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, for the Specific Action Step. The Specific Action Step is timed, physical and measurable.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">5_21_CAN-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, if you ask someone to do something, you better give them a darn good reason to do it. So next are the Benefits. As you outline your Benefits, be careful to avoid the common mistake of communicating benefits that are too general or too far removed to get anyone motivated to do anything.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We all want to be good corporate citizens, but when we just talk about ROI, increased top-line growth, greater customer satisfaction, or more streamlined work processes, it just doesn&rsquo;t mean a whole lot to us as individuals.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The best way to deliver high-impact Benefits is to go back to your Listener Profile and look at how you described your listeners.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Present them with Benefits that address their concerns, their goals and their needs. For example, if you described your listeners as risk-averse, present them with a Benefit that will give them peace of mind. If they&rsquo;re budget-conscious, tell them how they can leverage an existing investment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">5_23_CA-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">That wraps the Cornerstones, which you&rsquo;ll be able to use as a springboard for the rest of your message. Or, if you have a short message, the Cornerstones alone will give you plenty of content.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s take an example of a simple voicemail and see how the Cornerstones can totally shift the message. In my role leading Decker Communications, I receive calls from all kinds of people trying to sell me products and services, things like IT outsourcing, HR benefits and the like. One day, a sales pitch was left on my voicemail and it was so bad I almost deleted it, but then realized that it would be a great lesson in what not to do.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Take a listen to the message here:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good morning! Good morning, Miss Decker. This is&hellip; Sorry I missed you. Ma&#39;am, we primarily deal with speakers and consultants. What we do, is we help them achieve larger internet exposure. We do have NSA&rsquo;s top speakers as clients. We&#39;d like the opportunity to do the same for you. And we are cost-effective and proven to increase business and internet exposure. We are world class. We&#39;d very much like to hear from you if you&#39;re interested. My number is... We&#39;d very much like to hear from you. There&#39;s a lot we can do, I&#39;m sure, to help you achieve far greater exposure. Thank you, have a great day. Buh-bye.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, now you see why I didn&rsquo;t call him back. What stands out to you as you read the text on the screen?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was all about him, his company and his product.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, please don&rsquo;t dismiss this as a poorly scripted sales call. This is exactly what happens to all of us as we try to influence someone! We state all the reasons why we think we&rsquo;re great, why our idea is the best and it&rsquo;s a message all about us. It has nothing to do with the listener. His voicemail message looks even worse when we put it into the Cornerstones structure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Who&rsquo;s his Listener here? Anyone from his sales lead list. I could have been number 342 out of 500 people he called that week.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s his Point of View? Well, it&rsquo;s something called &ldquo;greater Internet exposure.&rdquo; The problem is that I don&rsquo;t have a clue what Internet exposure really means!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">What about his Action Step? His action is really weak: &ldquo;Call me if you&rsquo;re interested.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s certainly no specific action, nothing that is timed, physical or measurable.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And his Benefit isn&rsquo;t exactly compelling. It&rsquo;s that thing called Internet exposure again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I did go back and check out the company selling Internet exposure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It turns out that he&rsquo;s in the business of Search Engine Optimization and Search Engine Marketing. He helps companies just like mine get higher up on Google, Yahoo Search, etc.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, you&rsquo;d think that someone who is selling those services would have access to the Internet and could find out that Decker Communications, at the time, didn&rsquo;t have a very high search ranking because we didn&rsquo;t invest in SEO and SEM. Nearly all of our business was driven by word-of-mouth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here&rsquo;s the lesson: you might not know and you probably won&rsquo;t know everything about your Listener, but it&rsquo;s important to find out whatever you can. If he knew that before he called me and had tailored a message around it, it could have changed everything! Let&rsquo;s see how it applies.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this case, his listener, &ldquo;Anyone on my sales lead list,&rdquo; would have changed to &ldquo;Prospect with a poor search ranking.&rdquo; And his entire message would have shifted, then, from self-centered content to audience-centered content. It would have been directed to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">For his Point of View, rather than &ldquo;Greater Internet Exposure&rdquo; he could have said, &ldquo;Your prospects must be able to find you first.&rdquo; As a business owner, that would&rsquo;ve gotten my attention.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then his Action Steps could have been, &ldquo;Check out our company website to see how we&rsquo;ve helped others like you,&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;Please confirm a time that works for a follow-up meeting next week.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And finally, he could have listed Benefits that were a lot more compelling like, &ldquo;a competitive edge&rdquo; and &ldquo;a new revenue stream.&rdquo; Now, that would have earned a call back!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Alright, it&rsquo;s your turn. You&rsquo;re about to work through your own Cornerstones. You&rsquo;re going to go back to the Lab, this time using the Cornerstones that you've just created. If you haven&rsquo;t already, be sure to print off your Cornerstones for easy reference. You have 30-60 seconds, and we&rsquo;re betting that your message will be far more focused and effective &ndash; and probably even take less time. When you&rsquo;re ready, record your message.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">What did you notice? Were you more focused the second time? How would you have felt as an audience member listening to the message? Were you even maybe a little bit more excited to deliver it?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Take a moment to write a few notes, a quick self-critique about what was better the second time through, how the Cornerstones made a difference.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Always start with the Cornerstones to bring focus and frame your message for your Listener. Most of the time, though, the Cornerstones are just not enough. Our Listeners need more than a quick pitch to make a major decision or change. Often, our meetings are longer than one minute. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ve got you covered. The Decker Grid is flexible to accommodate a large or a small message. It&rsquo;s simply a framework that looks like this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&#39;ll create the meat of your message using the Grid. Here&rsquo;s the full picture.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ve already started your own Grid, with your Cornerstones already filling in the opening and the closing. The Grid follows the ol&rsquo; salesperson adage &ldquo;Tell &lsquo;em what you&rsquo;re gonna tell &lsquo;em, tell &lsquo;em, and then tell &lsquo;em what you told &rsquo;em.&rdquo; Your Cornerstones provide the open and the close, but now you have to flesh it out with the key points and subpoints in the body of the message.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">What does your listener need to know to buy off on the Point of View, take the Action, and realize the Benefits? You&rsquo;ll put these points in the three sections of the main body.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Think through things like current situation, solution, next steps. Or, what it was, what it is, and what it will be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You can think of key points as claims that you&rsquo;re making in support of the Point of View. Your subpoints, then, become supporting pieces of evidence. Here&#39;s a quick example of what a Grid can look like.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I worked on a message with the general counsel and senior vice president of compliance for a large energy company, who had the dubious honor of conducting a mandatory 45-minute compliance training session for the leadership team. Compliance training is typically right up there with waiting in line at the DMV. Awful.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Instead of making it boring, they started with their Listener Profile. They knew their team was full of big thinkers, with high integrity, who were really busy, so compliance was a low priority.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rather than just tell them that compliance was important and had to be covered, the Point of View had to really connect with these busy people. &quot;Leaders set the tone at the top...for everything.&quot; &nbsp;That shifted the focus from the training to the people. The actions: "Learn something new and surprising. Make it personal." And: "Create a plan to deliver 100% completion in your organization by Q2."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">"Benefits? Protect everyone - specifically, yourself, your team and our company." And: "Stay out of jail."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">5_31_CAN-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Cornerstones, check.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">To fill in the rest of the Grid, they thought about what the leadership needed to buy into the Point of View and take action. What were the key points and supporting details?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&#39;ll see they chose to begin with a broad message: "When bad things happen to good people."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then they moved on to what was specific to the company: "Surprising truths and new policies that you need to know." And finally, to individual teams: "How you can talk to your team to ensure compliance."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Okay, now it&rsquo;s your turn to finish your message. If you have any questions about what this should look like, take a look at a couple of Grid examples in your work station to get a feel for how this should flow.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">There you go! You have organized a message that&rsquo;s focused and relevant to your audience. You&rsquo;ll find that the Grid is flexible and versatile enough to prep for any situation. Whether you&rsquo;re leading an organization, mobilizing a project team, or planning a client meeting, an audience-centered message makes a difference every time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Second woman: “Bukulu is an open water source that is not protected. We share the water with the animals. My daughter began fetching water from the pond between her first and second birthday.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Third woman: “Getting water was horrible for us. Even when I was pregnant I would climb the big hill to fetch the dirty water. Someone in my family would go to the hospital every few months.”</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Which was more powerful &ndash; the statistics or the story?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">How many numbers do you remember from the list of statistics? You&rsquo;re doing pretty well if you remember one or two of them. But if I asked you about the story, how much detail could you share? You might even remember exactly what the women said. Stories stick. Numbers don&rsquo;t.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s bring it back to your day-to-day world. How are your messages remembered? Most of us don&rsquo;t stop and intentionally think about what will strike an emotional chord and what exactly will be remembered. Think about a meeting you have coming up with your boss. Maybe the stakes are a little higher than normal because you need to gain her buy-in on something that you know will make a difference, but she might be skeptical.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Your meeting with your boss is right smack dab in the middle of her back-to-back-to-back-to-back meetings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">By the end of the day, what will your boss remember? Do you really think she&rsquo;ll recall all of the key points and subpoints from your discussion? Fat chance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the last module, we completed the Grid, so that now you have a focused, listener-based message that ends in action.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Structure? Check. Logical flow? Check. But was it memorable? How do you make sure that it is?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The answer? Use SHARPs, which is an acronym for five powerful messaging strategies.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">6_04__S-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">S is for stories. They give you the most bang for your buck. Stories are emotional. They stir up feelings within us &ndash; suspense, sorrow, compassion, anger, joy and hilarity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stories are visual. As we tell them, the listener&rsquo;s imagination recreates our narrative as a series of images, like a movie that plays in their heads.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why stories enable us to connect with our audience in ways that statistics, graphs and bullet points do not. An engineer who went through one of our trainings was preparing to speak to his management team about the need for a new set of technical standards in the company - not exactly an initiative that would be at the top of the leadership team&rsquo;s list. He needed them to get it instantly and to care so much that they would shift resources to make this possible.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">His initial plan was to dive right into the bits and bytes. Instead, he opened with this:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Great Baltimore Fire of 1904,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;leveled most of central Baltimore. It burned for two days, destroyed fifteen hundred buildings, and put 35,000 people out of work. It was a tragedy that could have been avoided. Firefighters were on hand from neighboring communities of Washington DC, Philadelphia, New York and Atlantic City, but when they went to connect their fire hoses to the hydrants in the center of Baltimore, they couldn&rsquo;t. Their hoses didn&rsquo;t fit. Every city had a different type of hydrant, and those firemen had to stand by and watch the city burn. Like Baltimore in 1904, our organization will suffer if we don&rsquo;t standardize our technical equipment and processes.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The engineer&rsquo;s story was so powerful, he was able to communicate the urgency of the issue and get the attention of the leadership team. Without it, the initiative may have ended up on some future to-do list.</span>

    <p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">H is all about humor. One of the best ways to get your listeners on your side is to get them laughing. As long as your listeners are laughing, or even smiling, you won&#39;t find them nodding off or reaching for their mobile devices.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The key to humor is to take your topic seriously, but take yourself lightly. And we&rsquo;re not recommending joke telling. Just make sure to use common sense to keep your humor culturally appropriate, within the boundaries of good taste and politically correct.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If humor misfires, it destroys the experience, breaks the connection, embarrasses you, and leaves your audience feeling uncomfortable.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">A. Here we&rsquo;re looking at adding in analogies. A simple comparison to help your audience instantly get it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">For example: A financial advisor was working with a client challenged with taking care of both their college-aged children and their aging parents, but not giving proper attention to their own finances. The advisor used an analogy of oxygen masks on an airplane, stating that, &quot;You can&#39;t effectively help others until you are secure first.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And what about an analogy with a more serious tone? Would you ever text while driving? Sure, people do it all the time. But would you ever drink five beers in under an hour, then get behind the wheel of a car? Never. Yet texting while driving is the same thing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">6_07__R-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">R refers to references and quotes. Adding a third-party reference or quote helps frame your message, and it lends credibility to your topic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Take this quote by Albert Einstein: &quot;If I had an hour to solve a problem, I&#39;d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about the solutions.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">A product manager could use this quote to change the way her team approaches a challenge. Rather than jumping right into solution mode, she can emphasize the importance of creating space for thinking about the problem.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Einstein&#39;s quote provides credibility and motivates a different way of approaching the situation, instead of the product manager issuing another standard order.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Quotes are easy. Perfect for those of you looking to take a baby step into this whole world of SHARPs.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">P stands for pictures and visuals. These help bring your story to life. They make your information concrete, so that others can &ldquo;see&rdquo; your message.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, when it comes to visuals, think beyond just graphs and charts. It&rsquo;s not as if they&rsquo;re bad, but they should be used in a way that packs a punch, not in a series of data points and bullets in 8-point font. Instead, put a single stat on the screen. Add a visual image. Play a video clip. And then, hit your point. Check out this sample visual, where we packed three SHARPs into one slide.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It reads, &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s recession is an opportunity. Marathon and Tour de France racers will tell you that a race&rsquo;s hardest parts, the uphill stages, are where the lead changes hands. That&rsquo;s where we are.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">To create this visual, we pulled a quote from <i>Fortune</i> magazine and dropped it onto a stock photograph. The analogy is so compelling, it can be related to almost any challenge that a team or company faces.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">When creating your message, make sure to enhance your audience&rsquo;s experience with pictures and visuals.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So now that you understand the basics of SHARPs, let&rsquo;s look at how you can actually put them into play. You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to include all five of these SHARPs in every presentation, conversation or communication &ndash; just a few will do. Because SHARPs are essential to creating an emotional connection between you and your listeners. And if you want to drive action, such as close the deal, secure your budget, fire up your team, you need to appeal to people&rsquo;s emotions, which is exactly what SHARPs do. The key is to put them in the right places.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If we were to graph any audience&rsquo;s attention over time, typically their attention is highest at the beginning and at the end of the message. This is why you really need to capitalize on your opening and your close with SHARPs. Think about starting your message with a story, an analogy, or a quote. And the great thing about opening with a SHARP? It&rsquo;s just as good for you as it is for your audience. When you kick things off with a SHARP, it puts you at ease within the first 30 to 90 seconds, which is typically the most stressful part of any talk, pitch or presentation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In just a moment, we&rsquo;ll go back to the message you were working on in Module 5 so you can add in your own SHARPs. You&rsquo;ll see you&rsquo;ve got blank spaces for opening and closing SHARPs pre-planned on your Grid. Take a moment now to add a SHARP at your opening, and at your closing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">6_11_CAN-video</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now it&rsquo;s not just about capturing your audience&rsquo;s attention &ndash; it&rsquo;s about keeping it. So while you&rsquo;ll inherently have your listeners&rsquo; attention at the beginning and at the end, this does not mean you can allow their attention to dip in the middle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Remember that graph that showed the audience&rsquo;s attention? It&rsquo;s up to you to change it, to give your message more attention-peaks by adding in SHARPs throughout your content.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, take another look at your Decker Grid, and identify where you can add one to three more SHARPs to highlight a key point with a visual image, a quote or an analogy.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Did your message just get more memorable? That&rsquo;s the way to do it &ndash; by adding more layers of interest with SHARPs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Looking ahead now, in the next module, you&rsquo;ll be going into the Lab one last time. You&rsquo;ll get to take everything you&rsquo;ve worked on: your completed Decker Grid with those great SHARPs you&rsquo;ve just added, as well as the Behaviors of Trust that you&rsquo;ve already practiced. You&rsquo;ll bring it all together to communicate to influence.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here&rsquo;s where we bring it all together. It&rsquo;s a little like patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time. This module is where what you say meets up with how you say it. The message and messenger, combined, to create this powerful communication experience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re about to head into the Lab to deliver the message that you just created using the Grid. But first let&rsquo;s quickly review the Behaviors of Trust:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">For Connection, there&rsquo;s:</span>

    </p>
    <div>
        <ul class="c8 bullet-ul start">
            <li><span>Eye Communication. Remember to maintain three to five seconds of Eye Communication with each audience member.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>Posture. Get in your Ready Position, with that slight forward lean, which says &ldquo;I want to be here.&rdquo;</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>Gestures. You gotta go big and go home with those hands!</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>Facial Expression. Keep your face open and light.</span>
            </li>

    </p>
    <div>
        <ul class="c8 bullet-ul start">
            <li><span>Pausing. Use the power of the pause to eliminate the distraction of a filler word.</span>
            </li>
        
            <li><span>And Voice. Think about vocal variety in pitch and in volume.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">As you prepare for this exercise, your job is not to focus on all of the behaviors at once. Just use the two that you noted as your Pivot Points at the end of Module 4. You can reference these in your notes. These will make the biggest difference in how you come across.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In just a moment, we&#39;ll have you bring up the message that you created in Modules 5 and 6. You&rsquo;ll be able to use this as a framework; the Grid is designed to help you stay focused and organized throughout your message.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Think of each sticky note as a stepping stone. And remember, it&rsquo;s not important for you to use precise words for every single transition. You&rsquo;ll be able to pick up a thought from your trigger words, and then speak to it in a conversational manner. This way you&rsquo;ll come across as natural and authentic, not scripted and robotic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And the best part is that you won&rsquo;t be reading &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be communicating!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, if you haven&#39;t already, we recommend printing your Grid, which you can find in your work station. Or, you can email it to yourself to view it on your phone. If all else fails, you can click on the Grid icon while you&#39;re recording to bring up your Grid on the screen. If you hit a snag and forget what comes next, just pause, take a quick glance at your Grid for your trigger words, and you&rsquo;ll be right back on track.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">How did that feel? Were you able to pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time? You&rsquo;ll notice that at this point, you may have had the intention to do it all &ndash; put your best behaviors into practice and use your Grid for the first time &ndash; but when you&rsquo;re actually speaking, it&rsquo;s often not as easy as it looks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s part of the learning process, knowing exactly where you want to be, but not quite able to get there yet. What do I mean by this? Well, there are four stages of learning, and this plays out in everything from learning to play an instrument, to riding a bike, to speaking. There&rsquo;s:</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Let me explain a little bit more about each of these. When you began Modules 1 and 2, you were at Stage 1: Unconscious Incompetence. You didn&rsquo;t know what you didn&rsquo;t know. You may have had very little idea about how you came across to your audience, or what kind of experience you were creating for them. You just sort of blissfully went along, umming and uhhing and maybe even eye-darting from person to person. Then, you went into the Lab and saw yourself on video. You became conscious of what you were doing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was the Conscious Incompetence stage, where you started to understand what was going well, and what you needed to work on. This is where we start closing the gap between where we are and where we want to be.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Next is where the real work happens, in Stage 3: Conscious Competence. As you noticed in that last trip to the Lab, it takes major focus and awareness in order to shift and change those habits.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You have to consciously think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hold my eye contact longer, or pause and stop talking, or lighten up my expression,&rdquo; in order to actually do it. When you watch it back, you might even see this Conscious Competence in action &ndash; where at one point you weren&rsquo;t focused on your voice, and then you remembered your Pivot Points and started to add some vocal variety.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t be surprised if you take two steps forward and one step back along the way. Just keep going, it&rsquo;ll get easier.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And when you finally reach Unconscious Competence, that&rsquo;s where we all want to be. That&rsquo;s the state of &ldquo;learning Nirvana,&rdquo; where you don&rsquo;t even have to think about it, all your ineffective habits have been replaced with effective ones, where it&rsquo;s now second nature. And it comes from practicing, a ton. Think about driving. Riding a bike. Both easy - because of all the practice. So keep it up!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, you&rsquo;re about to watch your last message, the one that you just filmed in the Lab. Now, cut yourself some slack! You&rsquo;re bound to see some great changes that you&rsquo;ve made, but likely, you&rsquo;ll still need some room for improvement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Afterward, we&rsquo;d like you to give yourself a 3x3. That&rsquo;s our method for providing feedback. Look for three Keepers and three Improvements.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Why an equal number of both?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, where do we typically focus when we&rsquo;re critiquing ourselves? That&rsquo;s right, on the Improvements. We think, &ldquo;Tell me what I&rsquo;m doing wrong and I&rsquo;ll fix it!&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And how about when we&rsquo;re critiquing others? Well usually on the Keepers, the things they&rsquo;re doing really well. We jump in quickly to say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing a great job. Yeah, you could change a couple of things, but let&rsquo;s talk about the good stuff.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">But you&rsquo;re shortchanging yourself and others in either situation. The key is to give balanced critique, and try to make it specific, like the example here.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So as you watch your playback, make sure to pause the video to flag things that you&rsquo;ve done well, along with the things that you&rsquo;d like to improve. Be sure to include both behavior and content! Check out those Pivot Points, and listen for things like your Point of View, any SHARPs, a Specific Action Step.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s good to see how far you&rsquo;ve come, right? Congratulations! Now, take it to the next level. Look back through your flags and choose three Keepers and three Improvements.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Great job. You can use this feedback process to help guide your efforts as you work toward Conscious Competence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Remember, don&rsquo;t try to do everything all at once. The 3x3 will stop you from feeling overwhelmed by helping you limit the skills that you&rsquo;re working on. That way, you can actually focus.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Make sure to stay in the feedback process &ndash; ask a friend, peer, colleague, or a partner to help you out. The important part of the 3x3 process is that you get balanced feedback, making sure there are always just as many Keepers as there are Improvements.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, as we wrap up, let&rsquo;s check back in on your goals from Module 2. How&#39;d this course stack up? Were you able to meet your objectives? Make a note about how you feel about your progress.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You remember from each trip to the Lab that there is always an opportunity to tune up, and continue to get better. So as a final exercise &ndash; and in the spirit of having a growth mindset &ndash; how are you going to apply what you learned here in the Lab to your everyday life?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Take a moment now to identify Specific Action Steps you can take, whether in your professional or personal communications, to continue improving.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We love this quote from Will Rogers: &ldquo;Even if you&rsquo;re on the right track, you&rsquo;ll get run over if you just sit there.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re on the right track!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ve gained an awareness of your habits, both in how you come across through the Behaviors of Trust, and in how you approach your messaging with the Grid. You know how to move your own communication experience from information to influence. Continue to seek out feedback and opportunities to practice. Return to the Lab as often as you need to brush up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, don&rsquo;t just sit there! Keep improving and influencing!</span>
